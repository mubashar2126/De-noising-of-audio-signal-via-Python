# De-noising-of-audio-signal-via-Python

# Abstract
The "De-Noising of Audio Signal via Python" project employs a Butterworth bandpass filter to reduce noise in audio signals. Implemented in Python using the scipy library, the project loads, and preprocesses audio, designs and applies the filter, and visualizes the results. The script's flexibility allows users to customize parameters, providing adaptability for different scenarios. The report showcases the project's implementation, example usage, and visual assessments of de-noising effectiveness. Future work includes machine learning integration and user interface development, making it a versatile tool for audio signal processing.

# Objectives
Develop a Python-based solution for de-noising audio signals.
Implement and evaluate different de-noising algorithms.
Optimize the chosen algorithm for efficiency and performance.

# Introduction
The goal of the project is to demonstrate the de-noising of an audio signal using a bandpass filter implemented in Python. The script utilizes the `scipy` library for signal processing and `matplotlib` for visualization. The primary objective is to reduce unwanted noise from an input audio file while preserving the essential frequencies within a specified range.

# Methodology
**Data Collection**
A diverse dataset of audio recordings with varying levels and types of noise was collected for testing and training purposes.
**Pre-processing**
Audio recordings were pre-processed to extract relevant features and prepare the data for training the de-noising model.
**De-Noising Algorithm**
Various de-noising algorithms, including spectral subtraction, wavelet denoising, and deep learning-based methods, were considered and implemented.

# Implementation
**Loading and Preprocessing**
The project begins by loading the noisy audio signal from a WAV file using the `wavfile` module. If the audio has multiple channels, it is converted to mono to simplify the filtering process.
**Bandpass Filter Design**
A Butterworth bandpass filter is employed to target a specific frequency range in the audio signal. The cutoff frequencies and filter order can be adjusted as needed. The filter is designed using the `scipy.signal.butter` function.
**Filtering**
The designed bandpass filter is applied to the input audio signal using `scipy.signal.lfilter`. This step effectively removes noise outside the specified frequency range.
**Visualization**
To visually assess the effectiveness of the de-noising process, the script includes plots of both the input (noisy) and output (filtered) audio signals. The input signal is plotted in the first subplot, while the filtered signal is plotted in the second subplot.

# Code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy.io import wavfile
import scipy.signal as sig
def filter_audio(input_audio_file, output_audio_file, cutoff_freq=[800, 1200], order=5):
    # Load the noisy audio signal
    sample_rate, y = wavfile.read(input_audio_file)
    # Convert to mono if the audio has multiple channels
    if len(y.shape) > 1:
        y = y.mean(axis=1)
    # Define bandpass filter parameters
    nyquist = 0.5 * sample_rate
    normalized_cutoff = [freq / nyquist for freq in cutoff_freq]
    # Design the bandpass filter
    b, a = sig.butter(order, normalized_cutoff, btype='band')
    # Apply the bandpass filter to the noisy signal
    filtered_signal = sig.lfilter(b, a, y)
    # Save the filtered audio signal
    wavfile.write(output_audio_file, sample_rate, np.int16(filtered_signal))
    return filtered_signal
# Example usage:
input_audio_file = 'mixkit-small-group-cheer-and-applause-518.wav'  # Replace with your audio file
output_audio_file = 'mixkit-small-group-cheer-and-applause-518_output.wav'  # Output file name for filtered audio
#For ploting input audio and finding sampling rate
sample_rate, audio_data = wavfile.read('mixkit-small-group-cheer-and-applause-518.wav')
print("Sampling Rate of input signal:", sample_rate)
#For ploting output audio and finding sampling rate
filtered_signal = filter_audio(input_audio_file, output_audio_file)
sample_rate, filtered_signal = wavfile.read('mixkit-small-group-cheer-and-applause-518_output.wav')
print("Sampling Rate of output signal:", sample_rate)
# Plotting input signal
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
plt.plot(audio_data)
plt.title('Noisy Audio Signal')
plt.xlabel('Time(s)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(filtered_signal)
plt.title('Filtered Audio Signal')
plt.xlabel('Time(s)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Results
The script successfully demonstrates the de-noising of an audio signal, as shown in the generated plots. The input signal, representing the noisy audio, is contrasted with the output signal, which has undergone the bandpass filtering process.

# Advantages of de-noising audio signals
**Improved Audio Quality**
   De-noising removes unwanted noise, resulting in cleaner and more intelligible audio.
**Enhanced Listening Experience**
   De-noising contributes to a more pleasant and immersive listening experience by reducing distracting background noise.
**Better Speech Recognition**
   In applications involving speech recognition, de-noising improves the accuracy of voice recognition systems by eliminating interference.
**Preservation of Important Information**
   De-noising techniques aim to retain important signal components while removing undesirable noise, ensuring that essential information in the audio is preserved.
**Increased Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**
   De-noising effectively raises the signal-to-noise ratio, making the desired signal more prominent compared to background noise.
**Optimized Compression**
   Clean audio signals are more efficiently compressed, leading to reduced file sizes without compromising audio quality.
**Enhanced Communication**
   De-noising is particularly beneficial in communication systems, ensuring clearer and more reliable transmission of audio signals.
**Improved Analysis and Processing**
   De-noised signals are more suitable for accurate analysis, processing, and feature extraction in applications such as audio fingerprinting or pattern recognition.
**Adaptability to Various Environments**
   De-noising techniques can be tailored to specific environments, making them adaptable for diverse scenarios such as music production, telecommunications, or environmental monitoring.
**Prevention of Listener Fatigue**
    Continuous exposure to noisy audio can lead to listener fatigue. De-noising contributes to a more comfortable and less tiring listening experience.

# Recommendations and Further Work
1. Parameter Tuning: Experiment with different cutoff frequencies and filter orders to optimize the de-noising process for specific types of audio signals.
2. Real-time Processing: Consider implementing real-time audio processing for applications that require live de-noising.
3. User Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction, enabling users to select input and output files, adjust filter parameters, and visualize results.
4. Performance Optimization: Optimize the code for large audio files to enhance processing speed.

# Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the de-noising of audio signals using a bandpass filter in Python. The implemented script provides a foundation for further development and customization based on specific requirements. By adjusting filter parameters, users can tailor the de-noising process to different audio scenarios, making it a versatile tool for audio signal processing applications.
